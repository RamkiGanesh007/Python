"""Abdul and Numbers
After school hours, Abdul helps his father at his scooter repair shop. Abdul is always intrigued
with numbers and their sequence. Each time a customer leaves his/her phone number Abdul
likes to find the max length of substring that can be formed with this phone number, without
any number being repeated. Write a program for Abdul that takes a number and gives the max
length of substring.
Constraint: 3<=phone number<=10
Note: if the length of phone number violates constraint, print -1

Constraint:
3<=phone number<=10
Note: if length of phone number violates constraint, print -1
